Q - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

A - When also other people have to work on the same project like me.

Q - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A - Because I prevently need to understand if I actually want that the changes
performed by someone else on the remote repository do make sense also
in my working directory.

Q - Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

A - A 'fork' is a concept related to the GitHub platform only: you
usually fork a repository when you have no possibility to write to a
someone's else repository. A 'clone' is just copying a remote
repository locally, in order to work with it. 'Branches' are just
different flows, like the main stream of stable development (the
'master' branch) and different others, each for different goals (like,
e.g., introducing a new feature, or fixing a bug).
