Q - When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping
all your work local?

A - When also other people have to work on the same project like me.

Q - Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A - Because I prevently need to understand if I actually want that the changes
performed by someone else on the remote repository do make sense also
in my working directory.
