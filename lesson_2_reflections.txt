Q - What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to
do it?

A - A subdirectory with name '.git' is created in the directory I want
to initialize as a repository. The initialization is necessary in
order to have a file structure (in this case a directory with uts
content) that the Git application can recognise as a 'repository'.

Q - How is the staging area different from the working directory and
the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A - The staging area is conceptually in the middle between the working
directory and the repository. The repository and the staging area are
part of Git, the working directory not really, though it interacts
with it (it is part of the operating system). The value offered by the
staging area is that it decouples the working area from the
repository, letting to the user the freedom to choose which files are
actually to be added to the repository with each commit.
